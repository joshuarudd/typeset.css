# Typeset.css

A no-nonsense CSS typography reset for styling user-generated content like blog posts, comments, and forum content.

### What this is

Typeset.css is a CSS file (`typeset.css`) that includes all the styles you need to ensure content on your site is styled. Styles are only applied to areas that have a parent element with the class `typeset`, so it can be target content-specific markup.

### And what this is *not*

Typeset.css is *not* a CSS framework for styling the layout and design of your website - just specific blocks of content (e.g., blog posts, comments, forum content) that includes paragraphs, lists, code snippets, and so on.

### When to use this

Any time you have stripped a browser’s default styles or haven’t specified styles for content elements, use Typeset.css. It’s great for:

* Blog posts
* Articles
* Comments
* Helper text in web apps
* and any other content blocks on a page

Never again add content to your web page just to find that you don’t have a consistent style for it&trade;.

### Why this was made

Typeset was originally created for user-generated content on UserVoice feedback forums and then expanded to work with content generated by UserVoice-powered knowledge base articles. Because users create these articles using a WYSIWYG editor with HTML-editing capabilities, we needed to make sure we had a base set of styles for any content-related markup.

### How to use this

1. [Download](https://github.com/joshuarudd/typeset.css/zipball/master) and add the `typeset.css` file to your page.
2. Add the `typeset` class to the parent element that wraps the content you want styled with Typeset.css.

Example:

    <div class="typeset">
      <p>Like the generations of leaves, the lives of mortal men. Now the wind scatters the old leaves across the earth, now the living timber bursts with the new buds and spring comes round again. And so with men: as one generation comes to life, another dies away.</p>
    </div>
